# CS4101 Final Year Project

Files for my final year project in the National University of Ireland, Galway.

This project was to implement web app algorithms for various historical reckonings of the date of Easter.

The algorithms were derived from the reckonings of Dinoysius, Gauss, & Latercus.

For more information, please read my write-up of the project, which can be found on my website, http://taidghmurray.ie/other-work/

These calculators can be found in action at computus.app
